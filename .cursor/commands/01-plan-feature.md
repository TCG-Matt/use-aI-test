# Command: Plan New Feature

**Context:** I want to build a new feature: [INSERT FEATURE IDEA HERE]

**Action:**
1.  Analyze the current `spec.md` (if it exists) and the existing project structure.
2.  Ask me 3-5 clarifying questions to define the scope, edge cases, and data model changes required.
3.  Once I answer, draft an update for `spec.md` including a "Phase" checklist for implementation.

**Goal:** Create a solid plan before we write any code. Do not generate code yet.
